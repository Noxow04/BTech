# Positions

## static

Default position

## absolute

Exit the flux of the document, every other elements ignores it  
Absolute goes above other elements  
Using [top, right, bottom, left] to position the element in the body ('position from' i.e left: 20px = 20px from the left of the body)

## relative

Stays in the flux, at first  
Position itself relative to its original location, using [top, right, bottom, left]

## fixed

Position fixed to the page of itself, scrolling down will not affect it

## sticky (to avoid)

static at first then fixed when reached

## relative parent

absolute is relative within its first non-static parent

### directions

[top, right, bottom, left] can get negative
